== Scope

This Engineering Report describes an extension for storing Releasable Basemap Tiles (RBT) in GeoPackage developed during an OGC Code Sprint initiative.

This extension regroups requirements specific to storing RBT data products in GeoPackages, requirements for storing vector tiles in GeoPackages, requirements for defining semantic annotations in GeoPackages, as well as requirements to include portrayal information in GeoPackages.

In addition to the extension itself, this Engineering Report includes details of three implementations developed during the code sprint, including Technology Integration Experiments demonstrating interoperability between them.
